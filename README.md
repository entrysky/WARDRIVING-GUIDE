Stay safe when using a public access point or an open wifi network

🥶Use a firewall.

🥶Always use VPN. 

🥶When transferring sensitive information, make sure the site is using SSL (look for the HTTPS in the address bar).

🥶When on a public, unsecured network, I'd be leery of using credit cards or accessing your bank, etc.

🥶Don't leave your wireless card on when you're not using it.
